# dummy.data.Faker
using the Faker module to create dummy data for practice
this is a WIP and will be updated as I learn more about this neat Python library.
Not only can one use this to practice Python skills, one can also save the data as a csv file and export it to a local sql server and
practice SQL queries. Neato! 

the official docs are here: https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html
